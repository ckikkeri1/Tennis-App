# Tennis-App

In the spring of 2019, I worked on an Android application for the high school tennis team. 
I was previously the captain for the team in the fall, and I noticed that we were using paper and a clipboard to store player rankings and scores. 
I realized that there was a need for a more organized and efficient way to store data and communicate with the players, so I started working on the app. 
By the end, the app could record and sort a ranking system, store and edit player information in SQLite, have a calendar of events, and automatically send email reminders of events. 

The main files are in main/java/com/example/chirag/tennis/ (logic) and main/res/layout/ (XML).
